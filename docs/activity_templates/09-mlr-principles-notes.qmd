# Notes

## Learning goals

Working with multiple predictors in our plots and models can get complicated!

There are no *recipes* for this process.

BUT there are some guiding *principles* that assist in long-term retention, deeper understanding, and the ability to generalize our tools in new settings.

By the end of this lesson, you should be familiar with some general *principles* for...

-   incorporating additional quantitative or categorical predictors in a visualization
-   how additional quantitative or categorical predictors impact the physical representation of a model
-   interpreting quantitative or categorical coefficients in a multiple regression model

## Readings and videos

Please watch the following video **before** class.

-   [Interpreting multivariate models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnXwu1OWgMM) ([slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fiJL1IbReg6RJmjxRideYzYTyQtWR3Or/view?usp=sharing))

# Warm-up

Let's revisit the bikeshare data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
bikes <- read_csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/bikeshare.csv") %>% 
  rename(rides = riders_registered)

# Check out the data
head(bikes)
```

Our goal is to explore how registered ridership varies from day to day. To this end, we’ll build various **multiple linear regression** models of `rides` by different combinations of the possible predictors.

**EXAMPLE 1: Visualization review**

Let’s explore the relationship of `rides` with `windspeed` (quantitative) and `weekend` status (categorical):

```{r}
bikes %>% 
  select(rides, windspeed, weekend) %>% 
  head()
```

a.  Write a model statement for this regression model.

$$
E[rides | \_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_] = \beta_0+\beta_1 \_\_\_\_+ \beta_2 \_\_\_\_
$$

b.  Construct and discuss a plot of the relationship between these 3 variables. NOTE: Make sure that your description addresses all variables here, as well as the strength of the overall relationship.

```{r}
# Plot of rides vs windspeed & weekend
# Include a representation of the linear regression model
# PRO TIP: Start with a plot of rides by windspeed, then modify it
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed)) + 
  geom___() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

**EXAMPLE 2: Model review**

Let’s build the linear regression model of this relationship:

```{r}
bike_model_1 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + weekend, data = bikes)
summary(bike_model_1)
```

Thus estimated model formula is:

E\[rides \| windspeed, weekend\] = 4738.38 - 63.97 windspeed - 925.16 weekendTRUE

This model formula is represented by 2 lines, one corresponding to weekends and the other to weekdays. Simplify the model formula above for weekdays and weekends:

weekdays: rides = \_\_\_ - \_\_\_ windspeed

weekends: rides = \_\_\_ - \_\_\_ windspeed

**EXAMPLE 3: Coefficient interpretation review**

a.  The intercept coefficient, 4738.38, represents the *intercept* of the sub-model for weekdays, the reference category. What’s its *contextual* interpretation?

b.  The `windspeed` coefficient, -63.97, represents the *shared slope* of the weekend and weekday sub-models. What’s its *contextual* interpretation?

c.  The `weekendTRUE` coefficient, -925.16, represents the *change in intercept* for the weekend vs weekday sub-model. What’s its *contextual* interpretation?

## Interpreting MLR coefficients (2 predictors)

Consider a multiple linear regression model with 2 predictors:

$$
E[Y | X_1, X_2] = \beta_0+\beta_1 X_1+\beta_2 X_2
$$

Then

-    $\beta_0$ (“beta 0”) = expected value of $Y$ when $X_1$ and $X_2$ are both 0, ie. when all quantitative predictors are set to 0 and the categorical predictors are set to their reference levels.

-    $\beta_1$ (“beta 1”) = change in the expected value of $Y$ for two cases whose values of $X_1$ differ by 1 but who are identical in terms of $X_2$.

# Exercises

Let's revisit the bikeshare data:

```{r}
# Load packages & import data
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

bikes <- read_csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/bikeshare.csv") %>% 
  rename(rides = riders_registered)
```

Our goal is to understand how / why registered ridership from day to day.

To this end, we'll build various **multiple linear regression** models of `rides` by different combinations of the possible predictors.

```{r}
# Check out the data
head(bikes)
```

## Exercise 1: Review visualization

Let's build a model of `rides` by `windspeed` (quantitative) and `weekend` status (categorical).

a.  Write a model statement for this regression model.

b.  Plot & describe, in words, the relationship between these 3 variables.

```{r}
# Plot of rides vs windspeed & weekend
# HINT: Start with a plot of rides vs windspeed, then add an aesthetic for weekend!

```

## Exercise 2: Review model

Let's build the model. Run the following code:

```{r}
bike_model_1 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + weekend, data = bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_1))
```

The model formula with our coefficient estimates filled in is therefore:

E\[rides \| windspeed, weekendTRUE\] = 4738.38 - 63.97 \* windspeed - 925.16 \* weekendTRUE

This model formula is represented by 2 lines, one corresponding to weekends and the other to weekdays. Simplify the model formula above for weekdays and weekends:

weekdays: rides = \_\_\_ - \_\_\_ windspeed

weekends: rides = \_\_\_ - \_\_\_ windspeed

## Exercise 3: Review coefficient interpretation

a.  The intercept coefficient, 4738.38, represents the *intercept* of the sub-model for weekdays, the reference category. What's its *contextual* interpretation?

b.  The `windspeed` coefficient, -63.97, represents the *shared slope* of the weekend and weekday sub-models. What's its *contextual* interpretation?

c.  The `weekendTRUE` coefficient, -925.16, represents the *change in intercept* for the weekend vs weekday sub-model. What's its *contextual* interpretation?

## Exercise 4: 2 categorical predictors -- visualization

Thus far, we've explored a couple examples of multiple regression models that have 2 predictors, 1 quantitative and 1 categorical.

So what happens when *both* predictors are categorical?!

To this end, let's model `rides` by `weekend` status and `season`.

The below code plots `rides` vs `season`.

Modify this code to *also* include information about `weekend`.

HINT: Remember the visualization *principle* that additional categorical predictors require some sort of grouping mechanism / mechanism that distinguishes between the 2 groups.

```{r}
# rides vs season
bikes %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = season)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

# rides vs season AND weekend
bikes %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = season, ___ = ___)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Exercise 5: follow-up

a.  Describe (in words) the relationship of ridership with season & weekend status.

b.  A model of `rides` by `season` alone would be represented by only 4 expected outcomes, 1 for each season. Considering this and the plot above, how do you *anticipate* a model of `rides` by `season` and `weekend` status will be represented?

    -   2 lines, 1 for each weekend status
    -   8 lines, 1 for each possible combination of season & weekend
    -   2 expected outcomes, 1 for each weekend status
    -   8 expected outcomes, 1 for each possible combination of season & weekend

## Exercise 6: 2 categorical predictors -- build the model

Let's build the multiple regression model of `rides` vs `season` and `weekend`:

```{r}
bike_model_2 <- lm(rides ~ weekend + season, bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_2))
```

Thus the model formula with coefficient estimates filled in is given by:

E\[rides \| weekend, season\] = 4260.45 - 912.33 weekendTRUE - 116.38 seasonspring + 438.44 seasonsummer - 1719.06 seasonwinter

a.  Use this model to predict the ridership on the following days:

```{r}
# a fall weekday
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a winter weekday    
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a fall weekend day        
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___

# a winter weekend day
4260.45 - 912.33*___ - 116.38*___  + 438.44*___ - 1719.06*___
```

b.  We only made 4 predictions here. How many *possible* predictions does this model produce? Is this consistent with your intuition in the previous exercise?

## Exercise 7: 2 categorical predictors -- interpret the model

Use your above predictions and visualization to fill in the below interpretations of the model coefficients.

Hint: What is the consequence of plugging in 0 or 1 for the different `weekend` and `season` categories?

a.  Interpreting 4260: On average, we expect there to be 4260 riders on (weekdays/weekends) during the (fall/spring/summer/winter).

b.  Interpreting -912: On average, *in any season*, we expect there to be 912 (more/fewer) riders on weekends than on \_\_\_.

An alternative interpretation: On average, we expect there to be 912 (more/fewer) riders on weekends than on \_\_\_, adjusting for season.

c.  Interpreting -1719: On average, *on both weekdays and weekends*, we expect there to be 1719 (more/fewer) riders in winter than in \_\_\_.

An alternative interpretation: On average, we expect there to be 1719 (more/fewer) riders in winter than in \_\_\_, controlling for weekday status.

## Exercise 8: 2 quantitative predictors -- visualization

Next, consider the relationship between `rides` and 2 *quantitative* predictors: `windspeed` and `temp_feel`. Check out the plot of this relationship below.

This reflect the visualization *principle* that quantitative variables require some sort of numerical scaling mechanism -- `rides` and `windspeed` get numerical axes, and `temp_feel` gets a color scale.

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/155/bikes_multivar_3.png)

Modify the code below to recreate this plot.

```{r}
bikes %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = rides, x = windspeed, ___ = ___)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Exercise 9: follow-up

Describe (in words) the relationship of ridership with windspeed & temperature.

## Exercise 10: 2 quantitative predictors -- modeling

Let's build the multiple regression model of `rides` vs `windspeed` and `temp_feel`:

```{r}
bike_model_3 <- lm(rides ~ windspeed + temp_feel, data = bikes)
coef(summary(bike_model_3))
```

Thus the model formula with coefficient estimates filled in is given by,

E\[rides \| windspeed, temp_feel\] = -24.06 - 36.54 windspeed + 55.52 temp_feel

a.  Interpret the intercept coefficient, -24.06, in context.

b.  Interpret the `windspeed` coefficient, -36.54, in context.

c.  Interpret the `temp_feel` coefficient, 55.52, in context.

## Exercise 11: Which is "best"?

We've now observed 3 different models of ridership, each having 2 predictors. The R-squared values of these models, along with those of the simple linear regression models with each predictor alone, are summarized below.

| model          | predictors                | R-squared |
|:---------------|:--------------------------|:----------|
| `bike_model_1` | `windspeed` & `weekend`   | 0.119     |
| `bike_model_2` | `weekend` & `season`      | 0.349     |
| `bike_model_3` | `windspeed` & `temp_feel` | 0.310     |
| `bike_model_4` | `windspeed`               | 0.047     |
| `bike_model_5` | `temp_feel`               | 0.296     |
| `bike_model_6` | `weekend`                 | 0.074     |
| `bike_model_7` | `season`                  | 0.279     |

a.  Which model does the best job of explaining the variability in ridership from day to day?

b.  If you could only pick one predictor, which would it be?

c.  What happens to R-squared when we add a second predictor to our model, and why does this make sense? For example, how does the R-squared for model 1 (with both windspeed and weekend) compare to those of model 4 (only windspeed) and model 6 (only weekend)?

d.  Are 2 predictors always better than 1? Provide evidence and explain why this makes sense.

## Exercise 12: Principles of interpretation

These exercises have revealed some **principles** behind interpreting model coefficients, summarized below.

Review and confirm that these make sense.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Principles of interpretation**

Consider a multiple linear regression model:

$$E[Y | X_1, X_2, ..., X_p] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + ... + \beta_p X_p$$

We can interpret the coefficients as follows:

-   $\beta_0$ ("beta 0") is the y-intercept. It describes the average value of $Y$ when $X_1, X_2,..., X_k$ are all 0, ie. when all quantitative predictors are set to 0 and the categorical predictors are set to their reference levels.

-   $\beta_i$ ("beta i") is the coefficient of $X_i$.

    -   If $X_i$ is quantitative, $\beta_i$ describes the average change in $Y$ associated with a 1-unit increase in $X_i$ while at a fixed set of the other $X$.

    -   If $X_i$ represents a category of a categorical variable, $\beta_i$ describes the average difference in $Y$ between this category and the reference category, while at a fixed set of the other $X$.
